# Output Directory

This directory contains the output files generated by the Python script for extracting timestep data and processing molecule data from a simulation dump file. The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Extracts Timestep Data**: Reads a simulation dump file and extracts data for specified timesteps.
2. **Filters Atom Data**: Identifies clusters of atoms based on a specified distance threshold.
3. **Processes Molecule Data**: Counts the occurrence of different atom types within each molecule and writes the results to an output file.

## Files

The output files are named according to the timestep they represent, and there are two types of files for each timestep:

1. **Timestep Data Files**: Contain the atom data for a specific timestep.
   - Format: `<timestep>.dump`
   - Example: `470.dump`

2. **Molecule Fraction Files**: Contain the count of different atom types within each molecule for a specific timestep.
   - Format: `<timestep>molfrac.dump`
   - Example: `470molfrac.dump`

## Explanation of Output Files

### `<timestep>.dump`

This file contains the atom data for the specified timestep. The first 9 lines are header information, followed by lines of atom data. Each line of atom data includes:

- Atom ID
- Atom Type
- x-coordinate
- y-coordinate
- z-coordinate
- Velocity along x-axis
- Velocity along y-axis
- Velocity along z-axis
- Charge on the atom
  
### `<timestep>molfrac.dump`

This file contains the count of different atom types within each molecule for the specified timestep. Each molecule is represented by a dictionary of atom counts, followed by the count of occurrences of that molecule type. The format is:

AtomType1
, AtomType2
, ...
Count of this molecule type
